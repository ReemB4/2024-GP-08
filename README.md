<h1>Introduction</h1> 
<p>The absence of a user-friendly, specialized platform for Parkinson's disease hampers doctors ability to precisely evaluate and determine the disease's severity in patients. PDPrognosis is developed to overcome this obstacle by providing a supportive platform for doctors in diagnosing and treating Parkinson's disease. It delivers detailed analyses of patients' protein and peptide profiles, determines the severity of the condition, and enables comparison of patients based on proteins or scores. Additionally, the platform aids in tracking disease progression, provides comprehensive information on proteins and peptides, and cluster patients based on similar protein and peptide profiles, thereby significantly improving the management and treatment of Parkinson's disease.</p>
